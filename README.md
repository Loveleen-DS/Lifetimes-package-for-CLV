## Introduction
In a competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is essential for retaining customers and optimizing marketing efforts. This project uses the lifetimes package to estimate CLV, helping businesses focus on high-value customers.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess your customer transaction data.
2. **Modeling:** Apply the BG/NBD model to predict purchase frequency and the Gamma-Gamma model to estimate transaction value.
3. **CLV Calculation:** Calculate CLV by combining the model outputs.
4. **Analysis:** Use the results to inform targeted marketing strategies.

## Model Overview

### BG/NBD Model
Predicts the frequency of future purchases based on historical transaction data.

### Gamma-Gamma Model
Estimates the average transaction value, providing a comprehensive view of customer value when combined with the BG/NBD model.

## Results
By using these models, businesses can:
- Identify customers with high potential value.
- Predict future purchasing patterns.
- Enhance marketing strategies based on customer value predictions.
